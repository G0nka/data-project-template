# IRON HACK Data Project 1 README file
## from José Miguel González 

This is my first project as a former Data Science Actuary (I am already an Actuary so I am working hard on the first part :baby:).

## **What does this project do?**
Well, I think this is a pretty interesting way to put in practice all we have learnt so far:

- It imports a **db.** by using "sqlalchemy", there were some tables to merge so some SQL was used here!.
- It gets the labels of different job positions from an **API**, starting from a previous id. 
- More data from the internet was needed, but no API was available this time... so we used **webscraping** to obtain the complete name of the countries
- Once all the information is available, it performs a **cleaning** and also **group** the data to get some stats.
- Finally it saves a **.csv** with the conclussions.
